# project-week-1

## general requirements

- all the three tasks should be done in a team, no task can be done by a single team member.
- use git for version control, use dedicated private github repository for the project
- use markdown for all documentation
- the task specifications intentionally may contain not fully specified parts, so...
- start with compiling a **written**, numbered question list (strictly about the specification, not about the implementation), and provide it to the customer (gabor).
- all team members should commit and push to the repository in daily basis, the more often the better
- the commit messages should be meaningful, and also should contain the task/subtask number
- for commit messages use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- for branching use the [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model
- all team members should be able to explain the whole project, and all parts of it
- optionally use jira for task management (https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
